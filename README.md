## Course Directory
### React Front End with a REST API

</div>

### Description

This app was built using create-react-app and is the combination of a React Front End with a custom REST API I built that allows users to interact with a Course Directory.  In this full stack application, teachers would be able to easily use all CRUD operations relating to course creation and alteration.  They are only able to update and delete courses if they have the correct permissions.  Basic Authentication is used to encode user passwords during sign up.

### How To Use

After cloning this respository you can:

Navigate to the /api folder in your terminal and run:
```
npm install
npm start
```

Then open a new terminal and navigate to the /client folder and run:

```
npm install
npm start
```

If the development server does not direct you to the page, you can access the project at
```
http://localhost:3000
```
